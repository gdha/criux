Workflow cluster
================

Purpose: find out if we run a cluster and which kind of cluster (serviceguard, vcs, powerha, ???). 
We define a variable which decides the stage to be executed during this workflow (serviceguard is the
only stage that will be populated so far)

Furthermore, we run scripts which do some generic stuff like swlist output, patches, and so on (stuff
we can use or re-use on other stages or sub-workflows)

cluster 
 |
 +--> default: scripts that must run on ALL platforms and are OS independent!
 |
 +--> hp: scripts that are meant for HP-UX 11i HW
 |
 +--> GNU/Linux: scripts that are meant for GNU/Linux OS, be aware, if we only want SLEL then we might need other dirs:

See 'dump' output: the last 3 are good sub-dir candidates for above example:
 System definition:
 ARCH = Linux-i386
 OS = GNU/Linux
 OS_MASTER_VENDOR =
 OS_MASTER_VERSION =
 OS_MASTER_VENDOR_ARCH =
 OS_MASTER_VENDOR_VERSION =
 OS_MASTER_VENDOR_VERSION_ARCH =
 OS_VENDOR = suse
 OS_VERSION = 11
 OS_VENDOR_ARCH = suse/x86_64
 OS_VENDOR_VERSION = suse/11
 OS_VENDOR_VERSION_ARCH = suse/11/x86_64
