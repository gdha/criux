Workflow "cluster"
=================

This is the specific hp track where we will save some output files of the swlist, patches, ...
which we can use to grep in later on (no need to re-run swlist ...)

More important we want to identify if a serviceguard cluster software is installed so we can set
variable SERVICEGUARD_CLUSTER=1; this triggers in the workflow script lib/cluster-workflow.sh the
sun-workflow serviceguard (SourceStage) scripts/serviceguard
