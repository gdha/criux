How does this stage -init- work?

init/default: is always parsed!
init/hp: only parsed if architecture is HP-UX

for the rest the scripts always start with a numeric number (2 digits) and end with an extension .sh; files not ending with extension .sh are ignored when parsing (such as this readme file)

Furthermore, script 01_script.sh is executed before script 05_some_other_script.sh. However, keep in mind that the workflow script is located under the ./opt/criux/lib/ directory and in that script we defined the flow it will follow.

Keep in mind that it makes sense that the tree "init" should logical be parsed before the tree "cleanup" of course.

e.g. script ./opt/criux/lib/cluster-workflow.sh

function WORKFLOW_cluster {
# init will initialize CURRENT_STATUS variable
SourceStage "init"
SourceStage "cluster"
SourceStage "cleanup"
}
