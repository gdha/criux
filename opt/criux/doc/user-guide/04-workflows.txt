= Workflows
The workflows (or commands) available can be listed with the +-h+ option or +help+ command:

[source,bash]

# /opt/criux/bin/criux -h
    ....
    List of commands:
     cluster         check the cluster configuration

== Dump workflow
The dump workflow was already discussed during the configuration chapter. The output of `/opt/criux/bin/criux dump`:

The first part displays the system definitions, such as OS, hardware type and OS version.
The second part shows the configuration part and which files it could find (or you may define, create and/or use). They do not need to exist.

The following example shows the dump on a RHEL 7 system:

[source,bash]

These configuration files live under the +/etc/opt/criux+ or +./criux/etc/opt/criux+ (relative path) directory.
At this moment we have the following configuration files present (however, it will grow over time):

[source,bash]
----
    # ls -lR
    total 112
    drwxr-xr-x   2 gdhaese1   users         8192 Mar  6 13:39 GNU

== Mkdist workflow
The mkdist workflow creates a compressed tar file of the current development tree, which only makes sense when you are using the +git clone+ version of criux. The compressed tar file is stored under +/tmp+ file system and is called +/tmp/criux-0.9.tar.gz+ (the version can be different of course).

== Purgelogs workflow
The purgelogs workflow just has a simple function and that is to purge log files which are older than 30 days. It will display the logs it has purged (only when you are using the option +-v+):

[source,bash]
----
# opt/criux/bin/criux -v purgelogs
----

== Test workflow
The test workflow is a very simplistic test (use option +-v+ to see something):

[source,bash]
----
# opt/criux/bin/criux -v test
criux 1.0 / Git
Using log file: /home/gdhaese1/projects/criux/var/opt/criux/log/criux-20150225-1354-LOGFILE.log
no stale NFS mount points found
----

== Cluster workflow
The cluster workflow is the real work horse here
