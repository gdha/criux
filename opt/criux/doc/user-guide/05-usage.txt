= Basic Usage
Before digging deeper in +criux+ lets explain the basic usage. The option help (+-h+) will produce the following:

[source,bash]
----
# /opt/criux/bin/criux -h
Usage: criux [-dDFsSpvV] [-c DIR ] COMMAND [-- ARGS...]

criux comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details see
the GNU General Public License at: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html

Available options:
 -c DIR       alternative config directory; instead of /etc/opt/criux
 -d           debug mode; log debug messages
 -D           debugscript mode; log every function call
 -F           forcing preview or upgrade to continue when entering next stage is not allowed
 -s           simulation mode; show what scripts criux would include
 -S           step-by-step mode; acknowledge each script individually
 -p           preview mode; run all install or other commands in preview
 -v           verbose mode; show more output
 -V           version information

List of commands:
 cluster         check the cluster configuration
 dump            dump configuration and system information
 mkdist          create a compressed tar archive distribution
 purgelogs       purge the LOG [/var/opt/criux/log] directory
 test            a simple test workflow
----

Keep in mind that criux has an excellent man page too. See +man 8 criux+

It is important to know that +criux+ is a quiet program and will not show any output if you do not request for it with the verbose option (+-v+). Another point of interest is its excellent logging facilities as under +/var/opt/criux/log+ directory +criux+ keep a log file of each run. The log files are composed as follow `criux-<YYYYMMDD>-<HHMM>-LOGFILE.log`

We already mentioned the evidence files which are kept under +/var/opt/criux/+ directory. 

Starting up the program should be done by referencing the full path `/opt/criux/bin/criux` as the directory is not part of the +PATH+ variable, and we prefer to keep it this way to avoid accidents.
