== criux related configuration files

The configuration files that +criux+ uses are basically just shell scripts and should be treated as such.

The default location of the configuration files is +/etc/opt/criux/+. However, if you are working with the sources (e.g. via git clone) then it is perfectly possible to use the relative paths, e.g.

    ls $HOME/project/criux/etc/opt/criux/

The easiest way to explain which configuration files are possible is by showing the output of the +criux dump+ command:

[source,bash]

    #-> bin/criux dump
    criux 1.0 / Git

                                 OS_VERSION = 11.31
                             OS_VENDOR_ARCH = hp/ia64
                          OS_VENDOR_VERSION = hp/11.31

=== Default configuration file default.conf
The +default.conf+ contains lots of variables which should not be changed by the end-user. If you wish to modify one just redefine it in the +local.conf+ file. 


=== Local configuration file local.conf
The +local.conf+ should only contain variables which you want to overrule, as described in previous section (of the +default.conf+ file). It is important to know that the +local.conf+ file is the last configuration file read by +criux+ script and therefore, the variables defined in there are the last ones that will be used.

=== Operating Specific configuration files

On each OS you have specific OS related configuration files, e.g.

    HP-UX.conf 
    GNU/Linux.conf
    SunOS.conf

These configuration files typically contain variables which have only a meaning within that specific OS, e.g. on HP-UX

    SWINSTALL=/usr/sbin/swinstall
