== Criux not found
If you get the following error when you try to run +criux+

[source,bash]
----
# criux
sh: criux:  not found.
----

The reason is that the absolute path +/opt/criux/bin+ is not added the the +PATH+ variable. This is done on purpose to avoid mistakes! Therefore, always use the full path +/opt/criux/bin/criux+
